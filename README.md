# Cobre — Sr. Software Engineer Case: Notifications

## Context

Cobre is a transactional, cloud-native, event-driven and microservices platform that manages resources for clients (accounts, payments, transactions). This challenge designs and implements a **webhook-based event notification system**.

Full requirements: [`eventsApi/docs/Sr_Software_Engineer_Case_-_Notifications_(1).pdf`](eventsApi/docs/Sr_Software_Engineer_Case_-_Notifications_(1).pdf)

## Challenge Overview

### Task 1 — System Design
Design a scalable and resilient solution covering:
- **Delivery of event notifications** via webhook to a client-specific URL.
- **Self-service API** for clients to query and replay their notifications.

### Task 2 — API Implementation
Using **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Java Spring Boot**:
- Consume events and deliver them to the appropriate webhook endpoint via HTTPS.
- REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /notification_events` — list with filters by `creation_date` and `delivery_status`.
  - `GET /notification_events/{id}` — single event detail.
  - `POST /notification_events/{id}/replay` — re-send a failed notification.

Sample data: [`eventsApi/data/notification_events.json`](eventsApi/data/notification_events.json)

### Task 3 — Security
Identify at least 3 OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and propose mitigations.

## Data Model

> Source: [`eventsApi/docs/erd.puml`](eventsApi/docs/erd.puml)

![ERD - Cobre Notifications](eventsApi/docs/erd.png)

### Table Descriptions

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `clients` | Platform clients that receive event notifications |
| `event_type` | Catalog of event types (e.g. `balance_update`, `payment_created`) |
| `event_subscriptions` | Maps a client to the event types it subscribed to, including the target `webhook_url` |
| `event_notifications` | Audit log of every notification attempt and its delivery outcome |

### Key Design Decisions

- **`event_subscriptions` uses a composite PK** `(client_id, event_type_id)` — a client may subscribe to multiple event types; a single-column PK on `client_id` would not allow this.
- **`webhook_url` lives in `event_subscriptions`** (not in `clients`) — this gives flexibility to route different event types to different URLs per client.
- **`delivery_status` ENUM** uses `PENDING | COMPLETED | FAILED | RETRYING` instead of `created | completed | failed` — `RETRYING` allows the retry scheduler to distinguish in-flight retries from new notifications.
- **`retry_count`, `next_retry_at`** — required to implement an exponential backoff retry strategy as specified in the challenge.
- **`http_status_code`, `error_details`** — needed to diagnose failures, drive the `/replay` endpoint, and support near-real-time observability.
- **`secret_key` in `event_subscriptions`** — used to sign the webhook payload with HMAC-SHA256 so the receiver can verify authenticity.

## Self-Service API

Full spec: [`eventsApi/docs/openapi.yaml`](eventsApi/docs/openapi.yaml) (OpenAPI 3.0.3)

All endpoints require a **Bearer JWT** in `Authorization`. The `client_id` is always extracted from the token — clients cannot query each other's events.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/notification_events` | List events with optional filters and pagination |
| `GET` | `/notification_events/{id}` | Get full detail of a single event |
| `POST` | `/notification_events/{id}/replay` | Re-queue a failed event for delivery |

### Query parameters — `GET /notification_events`

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `dateFrom` | `date-time` | No | Lower bound on `creation_date` (inclusive) |
| `dateTo` | `date-time` | No | Upper bound on `creation_date` (inclusive) |
| `status` | `enum[]` | No | One or more statuses: repeat param (`?status=FAILED&status=PENDING`) |
| `page` | `integer` | No | Page number, 1-based (default: 1) |
| `pageSize` | `integer` | No | Items per page, max 100 (default: 20) |

### HTTP response codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Invalid query parameters |
| `401` | Missing or expired Bearer token |
| `404` | Event not found or not owned by the caller |
| `409` | Event already `COMPLETED` — cannot replay |
| `422` | Event is `PENDING` or `RETRYING` — already in-flight |
| `500` | Unexpected server error |

## Running the API

**Prerequisites:** Java 26, Gradle

```bash
cd eventsApi
./gradlew bootRun
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:8080`.

**Generate a test JWT** (no signature validation — `client_id` extracted from payload):

```bash
# CLIENT001 token
TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiJDTElFTlQwMDEifQ."

# List events
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/notification_events

# Get single event
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/notification_events/EVT001

# Replay a failed event
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/notification_events/EVT003/replay
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
cd eventsApi
./gradlew test
```

22 tests: 7 unit (ListService) + 7 unit (ReplayService) + 7 integration (Controller) + 1 smoke.

## Architecture

Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters):

```
domain/        ← Pure Java: records, enums, port interfaces, exceptions
application/   ← Use case services (plain Java, no Spring annotations)
adapter/in/    ← REST controller, JWT extractor, exception handler, DTOs
adapter/out/   ← JSON file storage, HTTP webhook delivery (RestClient)
infrastructure/← BeanConfig wires adapters to use cases
```

Storage is a JSON file (`data/notification_events.json`) loaded into memory at startup. The `NotificationEventRepository` port abstracts the storage so a real database can be plugged in without touching domain or application code.
